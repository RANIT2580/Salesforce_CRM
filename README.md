# Salesforce_CRM


Project Overview: 
The purpose of this project is to develop a CRM system specifically for managing the services provided by an institution. The CRM will serve as a centralized platform to handle all client-related activities, ensuring better tracking of service requests and relationships. With this system, the institution will be able to streamline its service workflows, automate manual processes, and manage client interactions in a structured manner. This will lead to increased efficiency, quicker service resolution, and improved client satisfaction.

Objectives:
Centralized Management of Clients and Service Requests: All client and service data will be managed in a single system, ensuring there is no loss of information, and allowing staff to easily access relevant data.
Service Workflow Automation: Tasks related to service requests (like creating records, sending notifications, and updating statuses) will be automated, minimizing the need for manual intervention and reducing errors.
Enhanced Reporting and Analytics: The CRM will generate reports that provide insights into service performance, helping management identify bottlenecks and make decisions that improve service delivery and client satisfaction.

Project Features:
			Client and Account Management: The system will provide a single view of all clients, their accounts, and associated services. All client interactions, history, and data will be easily accessible for staff.
Service Request Management: Clients can submit service requests, which will be tracked from submission through to resolution. This ensures transparency and accountability in service delivery.
Automation: Automated workflows will handle task assignments, send out reminders or notifications, and update service statuses. This reduces human error and ensures timely completion of tasks.
Reports and Dashboards: The application will generate detailed reports and visually engaging dashboards, offering management a clear view of key performance indicators (KPIs), such as number of active service requests, time to resolution, and client satisfaction metrics.
Technology Stack:
Salesforce CRM: This platform will serve as the foundation of the project. Standard objects like Accounts and Contacts will be used for managing client and institutional data, while custom objects like Service Requests will be created to handle specific project needs.
Lightning Flow: Used to automate key business processes like task assignment and status updates, Lightning Flow ensures the seamless execution of workflows within the system.
Apex: This programming language can be used to implement advanced logic and triggers that automate or customize more complex tasks.
Lightning Web Components (LWC): For custom user interface components, LWC will allow us to build intuitive and dynamic pages for interacting with the system.

Project Timeline:
Phase 1: Data model and object creation – In this phase, we will define the key objects (such as Accounts, Contacts, and Service Requests) and set up the relationships between them.
Phase 2: Process automation – This phase will involve implementing workflows, validation rules, and approval processes to handle the automation of service tasks.
Phase 3: Custom UI design – We will design user-friendly Lightning Pages and components to ensure ease of use for staff and management.
Phase 4: Testing and final deployment – We will thoroughly test all features and processes to ensure everything works smoothly before rolling out the application to end-users.

Expected Outcomes:
The Institution Service Management CRM will deliver several key benefits:
Efficient Client Management: All client and service data will be stored in one place, making it easy to manage relationships and resolve issues quickly.
Process Automation: By automating routine tasks, the institution will reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and ensure that tasks are completed in a timely manner.
Improved Service Delivery: The institution will be able to respond to and resolve service requests more efficiently, resulting in higher levels of client satisfaction and better performance overall.
